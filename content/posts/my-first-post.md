This is my first post on my new blog. It is built with **Hugo** and designed with the **Lynx** philosophy in mind.

## Why Minimalism?

1.  **Speed:** Fewer resources mean faster load times.
2.  **Accessibility:** It works for everyone, on any device.
3.  **Focus:** The content is the most important part.

It's a great way to build for the web.
