I am a postdoctoral researcher in [Chalmers University of Technology](https://www.chalmers.se/en/departments/cse/our-research/computer-and-network-systems/chart-research-team/) since May 2024.

My research focuses on enhancing energy efficiency, performance modeling, power modeling, and task scheduling in high-performance computing systems - CPUs and GPUs. The work involves developing adaptive energy-aware task scheduling techniques for OpenMP, CUDA, SYCL runtimes by leveraging hardware control knobs and task characteristics to optimize multi-objective energy-performance trade-offs. I am also interested in large language model (LLM) quantization techniques on GPUs.
